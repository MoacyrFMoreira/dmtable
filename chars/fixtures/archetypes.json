Unlike those Archetypes, the Visionary focuses principally on sharing the dream with others. Visionaries frequently face dismissal as foolish dreamers thanks to the fatalism that pervades Garou society, but a few manage to share their dreams of a Gaia that will be healed and strong when the Apocalypse has ended.",

Note that gaining support is the key to a Visionary regaining Willpower. Success need not come to a Visionary, at least not with every step in changing the structures in question."
